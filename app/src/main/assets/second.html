    <h3>
        WHY TEACH
        FINANCIAL LITERACY?
    </h3>
    <h4>
        It’s not how much money you make.
        It’s how much money you keep.
    </h4>
    <p>
        In 1990, Mike took over his father’s empire and is, in fact,
        doing a better job than his dad did. We see each other once or twice
        a year on the golf course. He and his wife are wealthier than you
        could imagine. Rich dad’s empire is in great hands, and Mike is now
        grooming his son to take his place, as his dad had groomed us.
        In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife Kim was 37.
        Retirement does not mean not working. For us, it means that, barring
        unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our
        wealth grows automatically, staying ahead of inflation. Our assets
        are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. You
        water it for years, and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. Its
        roots are implanted deep enough. Then the tree provides shade for
        your enjoyment.
        Mike chose to run the empire, and I chose to retire.
        Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would
        recommend that they do. “How do I get started?” “Is there a book
        you would recommend?” “What should I do to prepare my children?”
        “What is your secret to success?” “How do I make millions?”
        Whenever I hear one of these questions, I’m reminded of the
        following story:
        I doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men.
        If you look at the date, 1923, it was just before the 1929 market crash
        and the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great impact on
        these men and their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of
        greater and faster change than these men did. I suspect there will be
        many booms and busts in the coming years that will parallel the ups
        and downs these men faced. I am concerned that too many people
        are too focused on money and not on their greatest wealth, their
        education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind
        and learn, they will grow richer and richer despite tough changes.
        If they think money will solve problems, they will have a rough ride.
        Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without
        financial intelligence is money soon gone.
        Most people fail to realize that in life, it’s not how much money
        you make. It’s how much money you keep. We’ve all heard stories
        of lottery winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, and then poor
        again. They win millions, yet are soon back where they started. Or
        stories of professional athletes, who at the age of 24 are earning
        millions, but are sleeping under a bridge 10 years later.
        I remember a story of a young basketball player who a year ago
        had millions. Today, at just 29, he claims his friends, attorney, and
        accountant took his money, and he was forced to work at a car
        wash for minimum wage. He was fired from the car wash because
        he refused to take off his championship ring as he was wiping off
        the cars. His story made national news and he is appealing his
        termination, claiming hardship and discrimination. He claims that
        the ring is all he has left and if it was stripped away, he’ll crumble.
        I know so many people who became instant millionaires. And
        while I am glad some people have become richer and richer, I caution
        them that in the long run, it’s not how much money you make. It’s
        how much you keep, and how many generations you keep it.
        So when people ask, “Where do I get started?” or “Tell me how to
        get rich quick,” they often are greatly disappointed with my answer.
        I simply say to them what my rich dad said to me when I was a little
        kid. “If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.”
        That idea was drummed into my head every time we were together.
        As I said, my educated dad stressed the importance of reading books,
        while my rich dad stressed the need to master financial literacy.
        If you are going to build the Empire State Building, the first thing
        you need to do is dig a deep hole and pour a strong foundation. If
        you are going to build a home in the suburbs, all you need to do is
        pour a six-inch slab of concrete. Most people, in their drive to get
        rich, are trying to build an Empire State Building on a six-inch slab.
        Our school system, created in the Agrarian Age, still believes
        in homes with no foundation. Dirt floors are still the rage. So kids
        graduate from school with virtually no financial foundation. One day,
        sleepless and deep in debt in suburbia, living the American Dream,
        they decide that the answer to their financial problems is to find a
        way to get rich quick.
        Construction on the skyscraper begins. It goes up quickly, and soon,
        instead of the Empire State Building, we have the Leaning Tower of
        Suburbia. The sleepless nights return.
        As for Mike and me in our adult years, both of our choices were
        possible because we were taught to pour a strong financial foundation
        when we were just kids.
        Accounting is possibly the most confusing, boring subject in the
        world, but if you want to be rich long-term, it could be the most
        important subject. For rich dad, the question was how to take a boring
        and confusing subject and teach it to kids. The answer he found was to
        make it simple by teaching it in pictures.
        My rich dad poured a strong financial foundation for Mike and me.
        Since we were just kids, he created a simple way to teach us.
        For years he only drew pictures and used few words. Mike and I
        understood the simple drawings, the jargon, the movement of money,
        and then in later years, rich dad began
        adding numbers. Today, Mike has gone
        on to master much more complex and
        sophisticated accounting analysis because
        he had to in order to run his empire. I am
        not as sophisticated because my empire
        is smaller, yet we come from the same
        simple foundation. Over the following pages, I offer to you the same
        simple line drawings Mike’s dad created for us. Though basic, those
        drawings helped guide two little boys in building great sums of wealth
        on a solid and deep foundation.

    <h4>
        Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset
        and a liability, and buy assets.
    </h4>
    <p>
        If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is rule number
        one. It is the only rule. This may sound absurdly simple, but most
        people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle
        financially because they do not know the difference between an asset
        and a liability.
        “Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire
        liabilities that they think are assets,” said rich dad.
        When rich dad explained this to Mike and me, we thought he
        was kidding. Here we were, nearly teenagers and waiting for the
        secret to getting rich, and this was his answer. It was so simple that
        we stopped for a long time to think about it.
        “What is an asset?” asked Mike.
        “Don’t worry right now,” said rich dad. “Just let the idea sink in.
        If you can comprehend the simplicity, your life will have a plan and
        be financially easy. It is simple. That is why the idea is missed.”
        “You mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them,
        and we’ll be rich?” I asked.
        Rich dad nodded his head. “It’s that simple.”
        “If it’s that simple, how come everyone is not rich?” I asked.
        Rich dad smiled. “Because people do not know the difference
        between an asset and a liability.”
        I remember asking, “How could adults be so misguided? If it is
        that simple, if it is that important, why would everyone not want to
        find out?”
        It took rich dad only a few minutes to explain what assets and
        liabilities were.
        As an adult, I have difficulty explaining it to other adults. The
        simplicity of the idea escapes them because they have been educated
        differently. They were taught by other educated professionals, such
        as bankers, accountants, real estate agents, financial planners, and so
        forth. The difficulty comes in asking adults to unlearn, or become
        children again. An intelligent adult often feels it is demeaning to
        pay attention to simplistic definitions.
        Rich dad believed in the KISS principle—Keep It Simple,
        Stupid (or Keep It Super Simple)—so he kept it simple for us, and
        that made our financial foundation strong.
        So what causes the confusion? How could something so simple
        be so screwed up? Why would someone buy an asset that was really
        a liability? The answer is found in basic education.
        We focus on the word “literacy” and not “financial literacy.”
        What defines something to be an asset or a liability are not words.
        In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words “asset”
        and “liability” in the dictionary. I know
        the definition may sound good to a
        trained accountant, but for the average
        person, it makes no sense. But we
        adults are often too proud to admit that
        something does not make sense.
        To us young boys, rich dad said, “What defines an asset are not
        words, but numbers. And if you can’t read the numbers, you can’t tell
        an asset from a hole in the ground.” “In accounting,” rich dad would
        say, “it’s not the numbers, but what the numbers are telling you. It’s just
        like words. It’s not the words, but the story the words are telling you.”
        “If you want to be rich, you’ve got to read and understand
        numbers.” If I heard that once, I heard it a thousand times from my
        rich dad. And I also heard, “The rich acquire assets, and the poor and
        middle class acquire liabilities.”
        Here is how to tell the difference between an asset and a liability.
        Most accountants and financial professionals do not agree with
        the definitions, but these simple drawings were the start of strong
        financial foundations for two young boys.
